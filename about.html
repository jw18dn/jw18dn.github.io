            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              As a scientist I primarily focus on improving the abilities of legged robots. 
              My passion is to take on the most interesting and complex problems related to 
              building and controlling electromechanical systems. With a doctoral degree 
              in mechanical engineering, the majority of my work focuses on developing robotic
              control algorithms and implimenting them in C++ and/or python. In addition, I 
              occasionally assist in the design and testing of subassemblies which are then 
              integrated into the next generation robotic platform. Since my departure from
              academia in December of 2023 my focus has been on developing solutions to tackle 
              the real world problems legged systems encounter.

          <h2>Professional Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Jason White started his career with a B.S. in civil engineering from Virginia Tech.
            After working as a civil engineer, structural engineer, and construction manager he
            decided to change careers from site development and construction management to
            electromechanical systems. He pursued and received his Ph.D. from Florida State
            University, where hisdissertation focused on "Real-Time Planning and Control of
            Dynamic Robots in Dynamic Environments." His research spans model-predictive control,
            dynamic obstacle avoidance, and control of bipedal robots.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his time at Florida State University, he worked in the Optimal Robotics
            Lab under Dr. Christian Hubicki. His work has been published
            in top robotics venues including ICRA, IROS, and Humanoids. His contributions
            include novel approaches to real-time motion planning with integrated avoidance using quadratic
            programming, online gait optimization in resistive media, and through-contact
            locomotion generation via model-predictive control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon graduation he joined Ghost Robotics where he has continued his work as
            a controls engineer. Examples of the projects he has contributed to include improvements
            to the robots mobility (for both blind and vision locomotion), control algoirthms
            for a 6 DOF manipulator, R&D work pertaining to the next generation actuator assembly,
            and numerous code refactors.
