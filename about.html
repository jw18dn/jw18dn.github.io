            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a scientist that works on improving the abilities of legged robots. 
              My passion is to take on the most interesting and complex problems necessary 
              for building and controlling electromechanical systems. Although my degree 
              is in mechanical engineering, the majority of my work involves developing 
              control algorithms for robots and programming in C++ and/or python. 
              Since leaving academia my focus has been on making these systems work 
              in the real world.

          <h2>Professional Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Jason White received his Ph.D. from Florida State University, where his
            dissertation focused on "Real-Time Planning and Control of Dynamic Robots in
            Dynamic Environments." His research spans model-predictive control, dynamic
            obstacle avoidance, and force-based control of bipedal robots.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his time at Florida State University, he worked in the Adaptive and
            Reactive Robotics Lab under Dr. Christian Hubicki. His work has been published
            in top robotics venues including ICRA, IROS, and Humanoids. His contributions
            include novel approaches to real-time motion planning using quadratic
            programming, online gait optimization in resistive media, and through-contact
            locomotion generation via model-predictive control.
